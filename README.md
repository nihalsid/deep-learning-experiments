# ES and GA on MNIST

A set of neural networks implemented in tensorflow for testing out evolutionary strategies [1] and a simple genetic algorithm on the MNIST dataset

## Scripts

| Script      | Discription           
| ------------- |-------------|
| `conv_bp.py, mlp_bp.py`      | covnet and mlp trained with SGD |
| `mlp_es.py`     | simple mlps trained with ES, can train any arbitrary architecture      |
| `mlp_ga.py` | simple mlps trained with GA     |
